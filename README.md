# Faster_than_self
Faster than self (FTS) are different small programms that help with highlighting impermanence in experience by showing phenomena that happen faster than the experience of permanence.

Currently very much a work in progress. Next steps are setting up a github page, adding sounds, practice instructions and a guide for something somatic.
