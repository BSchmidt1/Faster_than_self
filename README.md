# Faster_than_self
Faster than self (FTS) are different tools that help which highlighting impermanence in experience by showing phenomena that happen faster than the experiences of self, permanence, suffering or attention.

Currently very much a work in progress. 

Still if you try it and want to give feedback/provide data I would love that. Should you profit a lot from the practice I am open to donations ;), but gaining insight is the best gift.

## Basic practice instructions: 

### Preliminary
* If you aren't already streamentry/have access concentration it might be helpful to first build up some concentration using your favorite method. 
* You can also use this to build up concentration starting with a simple noting practice for the yellow windows (replace with your favorite color) at a speed that works. 
### Main Practice

For now these instructions assume a high level of proficency in meditation and meditation safety:

Possibly take psychedelics if legal in your country and safety and so on ;)
* Notice any of the yellow (replace with favorite color) windows appearing.
* After some time add noticing the blue (replace with second favorite color) windows.
* Turn on the sounds possibly in different locations in your room
* Notice any of the 3 Characteristics in experience. 
* Possibly the perception of the speed of the windows might change with cycling through the insight stages, similar with the broadness of the visual field etc. (see www.mctb.org)
* Actualism oriented: Notice how the attention wave restricts perception. 

Future:
* Somatic tools
* Expanding practice instruction
* Theoretical background
* "N-dimensional" sound
* More complex/optimized sounds
* More interesting visual patterns
